# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
This project is a work day sceduler application. It represents a business work day in hourly block where users can input their plans and can save it to local storage, so their data won't get lost after closing the browser. For better transparency, time blocks are colourised. Hours in the past are grey, the current hour is red, and the future hours are green.

## How to play
It's an easy-to-use application. Just click on the wide colourised area in any timeblock and type in your plans. Then click to the save button and it will be saved to the local storage.
